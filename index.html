        <p>Anyone who comes to my country really should spend some time in Barcelona, it’s a beautiful place, it’s not what you would call a sprawling city. It’s quite compact really and you could walk across the city in a couple of hours, but
          there’s no need to do that as we have a fantastic public transport system so it’s easy to get around. There are various districts all with their own character, there are the upmarket shops in the centre. So, you’ll find lots of chain stores
          you’ll recognise from your own country but also local brands as well. We have the narrow streets in the Gothic district with lots of fashionable boutiques and tourist attractions. There’s the Olympic area and the beaches along the coast …
          and dotted around the city are some lovely public spaces, parks and squares in the city centre and on the outskirts of Barcelona where people relax with their friends and family and of course pavement cafes everywhere. All that and some
          great historical places of interest … so a great destination for tourists …</p>
